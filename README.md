# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Project Objective
- Extract insights from the Titanic dataset through statistical summaries and visualizations.
- Understand relationships between features such as Age, Fare, Pclass, Sex, and Survival.
- Identify patterns that influenced passenger survival.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset Information
The dataset includes the following features:
- **PassengerId**: Unique ID for each passenger
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Name**: Passenger's full name
- **Sex**: Gender
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Amount paid for the ticket


## Key Findings
- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive than second or third-class passengers.
- Passengers who paid higher fares had better survival chances.
- Younger passengers and small family groups showed slightly better survival outcomes.
